#  Virtual Network Peering(Three regions) + Private DNS Zone

### Here I am going to create three different network in different regions then configuring peering with DNS name resolution
* So Only one VM will be accessible from outside the compagny 
* Other network's vm, we can access even though there are in different region and different network
* Plus we can use private DNS name to access those website.
